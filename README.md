# Dynamic-Linear-Data-structures-and-Recursion  
Implementation of a sentence's words reversal without changing the characters  

Application features
- Loads data from a text file given  
- Load each line into a linear dynamic data structure  
- Reverse the words  
- Show the required output  
- Save data into text file as required  
- if the input contains invalid data, the aplication will stop executing and notify the user  

Example of input:
10  
github on go will this  
proving that sentences are reversed  
using dynamic linear data structures  
therefore only allocating the required space in memory  
the task is to reverse all these words  
using recursion  
while also recording the amount of data being manipulated  
This is the moment i fell in love with programming  
more gibberish to fill out lines  
ten lines in total  

Output:

Start Time = Thu Mar 29 11:59:22 2018  
The number of words in the file is 62  
The number of characters in the file is 305  
Case 1: this will go on github   
Case 2: reversed are sentences that proving  
Case 3: structures data linear dynamic using   
Case 4: memory in space required the allocating only therefore  
Case 5: words these all reverse to is task the  
Case 6: recursion using  
Case 7: manipulated being data of amount the recording also while  
Case 8: programming with love in fell i moment the is This  
Case 9: lines out fill to gibberish more  
Case 10: total in lines ten  
End Time = Thu Mar 29 11:59:22 2018  
Execution time = 0 Seconds
